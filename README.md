# clavim
A text editor that I do not intend on using.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```
SDL2
SDL2_ttf
```

### Installing

* Install [SDL2](http://libsdl.org/download-2.0.php)
* Install [SDL2_ttf](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/)

## Usage

1. Clone and compile:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/claby2/clavim.git

```
2. Run clavim by specifying the path to the file you would like to edit (the following example opens `filename.txt`):
